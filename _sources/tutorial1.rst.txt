EG detection and predition for two tissues 
==========================================

In notebook we show how

1. starting from the CRISPR file we apply the HELP labelling algorithm to detect essential genes (EGs) and non-essentials
genes (NEGs) in two tissues and in all tissues (pan-tissue).
2. by subtracting pan-tissue EGs from a tissue EGs list we get the context-specific EGs (csEGs)
3. by using tissue specific attributes (genomic, functional, PPI structural, etc.) we develop a LighGBM prediction model for EGs.
